 For this assignment I got help from a tutor from Wyzant.com named Alex Eustir. I also worked with Ian Paul understanding concepts of pipes and message queues. 

 I was never able to complete the assignment. At one point I was at the combiner stage and able to recieve words from each sub sorted processed message queue. While trying to do the combinder stage I tried many things, including a swaping function that essentially went through the first messages recieved from each sub sorted process, put them in a dynamic array, then sorted through that with a swapping function that would either reset when strcmp equaled -1 so I needed to perform a swap and I had to going through the array again. Or, when the function looped through completely and didn't need to swap, it would finally add to a print array while keeping track of the count. I was close at figuring this out but never could quite get it. 

 At a point where I was able to recieve all the sub sorted proceeses messages and print out those words, even on a large data file like words.txt, I attempted to save that version. However, a nightmare happened and though I asked Cyberduck to rename my version and add it to the desktop, it did not, and that copy was lost. 

 Now my program demonstrates that I can properly parse the words, send them to a message queue, and then create n sub processes that recieve the parsed words, that are then added to a dynamic array. Once all the parsed words have been sent, I am able to perform qsort on each sort subprocess and send the sorted wrods back to their own message queues. Then I am able to recieve the words from those queues and print them out. However, this only works on small data files and big data files like words.txt stop around letters that begin with "e". I know this is because the flow of my message queues is not correctly set up and each sub sorted processes message queue gets blocked with the flow of data. I spent two days trying to figure out how to implement signals and was never able to figure it out, so I know that is where my program is having problems. I wish I had been taught how to use signals and message queues with child processes more because it was my lack in understanding of those concepts that inhibited me from being able to finish the assignment. In fact I even made a function that would have printed the desired output with the sorted words and their count, however I wasn't able to implement it since recieving stops at "e" on large data files.
