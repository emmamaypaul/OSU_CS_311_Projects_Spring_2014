	A note about permissions:  Anything you put in the top class
	directory will be world readable through file system access.
	Anything you put in public_html will be readable from the web.
	A directory named 'private' has been provided that is only
	available to you (and your TAs if you chose to have TA
	access).  The 'private' directory won't allow student access.
	If you create any other directories or files within the main
	class directory, make sure that you check and understand the
	permissions.  Unless you change the permissions, it will allow
	open read access to anyone.

	Feel free to mail support if you have any questions...
